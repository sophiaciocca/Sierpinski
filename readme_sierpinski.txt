/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe your artistic creation, and how you went about writing   
 *  a program to produce it. If you used any sources such as the book
 *  or booksite, reference them here. 
 **********************************************************************/

    I decided to try using squares instead of triangles, so I used the 
    booksite to find the command to draw a square, then altered the 
    recursive calls to have four and to use the radius instead of 
    the triangle arrays. It looks super cool, check it out


/**********************************************************************
 *  List whatever help (if any) that you received, and the names of
 *  any students with whom you collaborated.                          
 **********************************************************************/

    Christian Barcenas is the best

/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.                    
 **********************************************************************/

    I'm a little worried about the fact that my Art program takes longer
    than 10 seconds when you run it with argument 8. I can't really
    find a way to ameliorate this


/**********************************************************************
 *  List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback   
 *  on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether    
 *  you enjoyed doing it.

    Recursion is cool. Hopefully I'll be better at it soon
